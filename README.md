# 🛒 E-Com Support Agent

### An AI Assistant for Product and Order Inquiries

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In e-commerce, customers expect **instant, accurate answers** to their questions — from product availability and delivery timelines to return policies. Traditional chatbots often fail to meet these expectations. They rely on **predefined scripts**, cannot handle unstructured queries, and lack contextual memory.

For example, when a user asks, *“Is the iPhone 15 Pro in stock?”* or *“What’s the status of order ORD123?”*, rule-based bots often fail to retrieve accurate, real-time data. This leads to frustration, long wait times, and lost trust.

Meanwhile, generic large language model (LLM) chatbots, though conversational, tend to **hallucinate** — making up data or giving inconsistent factual responses.

This highlights a core challenge:

> How can we build a conversational system that combines **LLM intelligence** with **factual accuracy and structured action**?

That’s where **agents** come in.

## 🤖 Why Agents?

Agents are intelligent systems that **think, act, and remember**. Unlike simple chatbots, agents can decide what to do next, execute functions, and integrate with tools or APIs.

Using **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, the E-Com Support Agent leverages the power of Gemini models with structured logic, enabling it to:

* **Understand intent** using an LLM
* **Invoke custom tools** (functions) for real-time tasks
* **Access and update memory** to maintain context
* **Return accurate, dynamic responses** instead of static templates

Agents provide the flexibility to scale across multiple workflows — making them perfect for domains like e-commerce, where queries involve structured information, reasoning, and integration with other systems (inventory, shipping, returns).

## 🧱 What I Created

### 🌟 Overview

The **E-Com Support Agent** is a conversational AI assistant that handles product questions, order inquiries, and return policies for an online electronics retailer.

It uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** (for speed and cost-efficiency) and the **Google ADK framework** to integrate multiple tools, memory, and observability into one cohesive system.

### 🏗️ Architecture

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                  E-Com Support Agent                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite                         |
| Tools:                                                |
|   • get_product_info()                                |
|   • get_order_status()                                |
|   • get_return_policy()                               |
|   • load_memory()                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Memory: InMemoryMemoryService                         |
| Session: InMemorySessionService                       |
| Observability: LoggingPlugin                          |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 🧰 Key Tools

* **get_product_info(product_name):** Retrieves details like price, stock, and specs.
* **get_order_status(order_id):** Simulates order tracking.
* **get_return_policy(country):** Provides localized return information.
* **load_memory():** Recalls past user data like country or preferences.

When a customer asks a question, the agent uses Gemini to understand intent, selects the right tool, executes it, and formulates a natural reply.

## 🎥 Demo

**Example Conversation:**

```
User > Hi, what’s your return policy for India?
Agent > For India: You can return most items within 10 days of delivery. Pickup is arranged for eligible locations.

User > Tell me about the MacBook Pro 14.
Agent > The MacBook Pro 14 costs $1,999 and has an M3 Pro chip, 18GB RAM, and 512GB SSD. It’s in stock (22 units).

User > What’s the status of my order ORD123?
Agent > Your order ORD123 has been shipped with DHL and will arrive in 3–5 business days.
```

Each response involves structured reasoning — not static replies. The agent invokes tools for product or order data and combines that with conversational output.

## ⚙️ The Build

### 1. **Setup and Environment**

Installed dependencies:

```bash
pip install google-adk opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai
```

Configured the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and environment variables for Gemini access.

### 2. **Agent Definition**

Built a Python agent using ADK’s `LlmAgent` class, defining tools and system instructions.

```python
root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
    instruction="You are a helpful support assistant.",
    tools=[get_product_info, get_order_status, get_return_policy]
)
```

### 3. **Memory and Session Management**

Used `InMemorySessionService` and `InMemoryMemoryService` to preserve context and recall facts within and across interactions.

### 4. **Observability**

Integrated ADK’s `LoggingPlugin` to trace every function call and model interaction, allowing debugging and performance monitoring.

### 5. **Testing and Evaluation**

Created `integration.evalset.json` and `test_config.json` to test correctness.
Executed:

```bash
adk eval ecom_support_agent ecom_support_agent/integration.evalset.json
```

Results:
✅ Tool trajectory accuracy: 1.0
✅ Response similarity: ≥ 0.8

### 6. **Deployment Ready Structure**

Prepared the directory with `.agent_engine_config.json` and environment files for deployment to **Vertex AI Agent Engine**, Google’s managed runtime for production agents.

## 🧪 Evaluation

The agent was tested on 20 sample queries spanning product, order, and policy tasks.
It consistently selected the correct tool and produced clear, contextually appropriate responses.

| Metric                   | Description          | Score |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----- |
| Tool trajectory accuracy | Correct use of tools | 1.0   |
| Response match           | Semantic correctness | 0.9   |
| Context retention        | Session consistency  | High  |

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)** – Agent creation framework
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** – Low-latency, cost-efficient LLM
* **Python** – Tool implementation and orchestration
* **Vertex AI Agent Engine (optional)** – Deployment target
* **ADK Evaluation Suite** – Agent testing framework
* **OpenTelemetry Logging** – Observability and metrics

---

## 🌐 Architecture Flow

```
User Query  →  LLM (Gemini 2.5)  →  Tool Selection  
            →  Tool Execution (Python)  →  Memory Update  
            →  Final Response Generation  
```

Example:
“Is the iPhone 15 Pro in stock?” → Gemini interprets → `get_product_info("iPhone 15 Pro")` → returns structured data → human-readable answer.

## 🚀 If I Had More Time

If expanded, the next steps would include:

1. **API Integration:** Connect tools to live systems like Shopify or FedEx APIs for real-time data.
2. **Persistent Memory:** Use Vertex AI Memory Bank to remember user preferences (currency, language).
3. **Multi-Agent System:** Add specialized sub-agents (e.g., Shipping Agent, Payment Agent) using the A2A protocol.
4. **Web Interface:** Build a chat UI using Streamlit or Flask for interactive demos.
5. **Advanced Observability:** Add tracing dashboards via Vertex Monitoring to track user engagement and latency.
